# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repo was created as part of the final course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data", 
the third course in Johns Hopkins University's and Coursera's Data Science Specialization.

### Overview

This project tasked course participants with collecting and tidying a data compiled by and made available through 
the University of California-Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. Information pertaining to the data and those involved in the research can be found [here.] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
The zipped file, found [here,] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/) contains data collected from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone accelerometers and gyroscopes of 30 subjects performing each of 6 activities.

### Project Specifics

Per project instructions, course participants were to create an R script titled ["run_analysis.R"](https://github.com/ncosentino100/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/master/run_analysis.R) that will:
  1. Merge the training and test sets to create one data set;
  2. Extract only the measurements on the mean ("mean( )") and standard deviation ("std( )") for each measurement taken;
  3. Assign descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
  4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names;
  5. Create a second, [tidy data set](https://github.com/ncosentino100/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/master/variableaverages.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the the data set created in steps 1-4.

### Data, Variables and Transformations

Further explanations of the data used in this project, the varibles found therein, and the transformations done to the data through run_analysis.R are included in the [CodeBook.MD file.](https://github.com/ncosentino100/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/master/CodeBook.md)
